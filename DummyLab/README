This archive is meant to help you familiarize yourself with the testing facilities used throughout 
 all the lab assignments. You will implement a function which always returns the constant 0 given an
 input of type int option. The archive contains the following files and directories:

 1. sources.cm
 2. support.cm
 3. lib/
 4. RefSol.sml
 5. tester.sml
 6. README file
 7. Assignment.pdf
 8. Tests.sml *
 9. Sol.sml *

You should only modify the last 2 files, denoted by *. Put the implementation in Sol.sml. 
Do NOT modify other parts of the file.

To aid with testing we have provided a testing structure, Tester, which should simplify the testing process. 
Tester will test your implementations against test cases speciÔ¨Åed within Tests.sml.
Test cases should be added to the tests list in the Tests structure. To compile and load everything into the SML/NJ REPL,
run 'CM.make "sources.cm"' within the REPL.In order to test your code, after running CM.make, 
you will need to call the following function:
Tester.testZero ()
